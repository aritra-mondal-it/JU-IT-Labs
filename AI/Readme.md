## 🚀 Getting Started in Google Colab

You can run each assignment notebook directly in **Google Colab**, a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the cloud—no installation required.

### 🧾 Steps to Use Google Colab

1. Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) or search “Colab” in your browser.
2. Make sure you're signed in with your Google account.
3. Click **File → Open notebook** → Select `GitHub` tab → Paste this repository URL (which is `https://github.com/damaclab/AI` since you provided it at the end).
4. Alternatively, open a notebook directly by clicking on the file link (e.g., `assignment0.ipynb`) and selecting **"Open in Colab"**.

### 📦 Uploading Files in Colab

For file-based tasks (e.g., reading `.txt` files):

1. **Shell Command based upload:**
    ```python
    from google.colab import files
    files.upload()
    ```
2. **Manual upload by mounting Google Drive:**
    You can manually mount your Google Drive by clicking on the left sidebar, then click on the files icon (fifth from top), and then click on the drive function and grant access.
